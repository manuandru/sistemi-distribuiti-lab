1. Inspect and understand the project structure and the provided Java sources
    + both main and test code

2. Try to **compile** the project via Gradle
    + you may add a syntax error somewhere in the Java source and re-compile to see what an error looks like

3. Try to **test** the project via Gradle
    + you may add a failed assertion somewhere in test code and re-test to see what a failed test case looks like

4. Try to **run** the project via Gradle
    + what should happen? what do you expect?
